# OUR Micro Internship Program Fall 2021
This repository contains code used for researching during Miguel Jover's Fall 2021 OUR Micro Internship Scholar program.

It is led and mentored by Dr. Minwoo Jake Lee, an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of North Carolina Charlotte. Read more about him [here](https://webpages.uncc.edu/mlee173/).

### Project Description
As the human cognitive load grows for interactions with AI, direct brain communication has emerged as an alternative solution for communication between humans and AI. This short-term project aims to learn different classification methods and test them on collected EEG brain signal data for the detection of error-related potentials (ERPs).


## Objectives
- [ ] Learn NumPy 
- [ ] Learn Scikit-Learn
- [ ] Apply classification models to EEG brain data
